# Data Analytics Capstone Project: Nintendo Sales Strategy

## Introduction:
In this project I used a dataset provided by Kaggle that contains a list of video games with sales, critic and users score. 
There are 55,792 records in the dataset as of April 12th, 2019

Rank - Ranking of overall sales, Name - Name of the game, Platform - Platform of the game (i.e. PC, PS4, XOne, etc.), Genre - Genre of the game, ESRB Rating - ESRB Rating of the game, Publisher - Publisher of the game, Developer - Developer of the game, Critic Score -, Critic score of the game from 10, User Score - Users score the game from 10, Total Shipped - Total shipped copies of the game, Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales (in millions), NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions), PAL_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions), JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions), Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions), Year - Year of release of the game

## Objective:
The objective of this anlaysis is to come up with a strategy to increase Nintendo's video game sales by +10% in the next year through market prioritization, regional localization, and new product development. As the video game industry has become a competitive and shirinking market in the past two decades. This analysis provides methods and opportunites for Nintendo to accelerate sales to stay competitive in 4 regions, NA, PAL, JP and Other.  

## Tools used:
Data analysis incorporated descriptive and inferential statistics through correlational coefficient, linear regressions, boxplots, histograms etc. 
Exploratory analysis and visuals were conducted and created through Excel. Some visuals were created in Tableau. 
The Boston Consulting group’s growth-share matrix (BCG matrix) was used to design Nintendo's business strategy, through defining the company's main competitors and market position relative to global sales. 

## Results:
After completion of analysis it was determined that to increase revenue​ the grocery store would need to plan to be open on all available Trade Days (targeting summer months)​ and improve marketing for summer months (specifically around sporting events) and trade days.

To limit unnecessary costs it was recommended to increase stocking of perishable items during summer months only (specifically the categories of Produce/Dairy and Meat​) and to limit stocking of packages, facial tissue, eggs, cigarettes, and phone items available in store​.
